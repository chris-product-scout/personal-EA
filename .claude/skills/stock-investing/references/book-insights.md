Synthesized wisdom from Graham, Buffett, Lynch, Greenblatt, and O'Glove—tailored for aggressive growth tech investing.

## Your Investment Context

**Profile**: Aggressive growth tech investor using retirement accounts (high risk tolerance acceptable). Tech background provides circle of competence advantage.

**Macro Theses**:
- AGI: 5-year horizon—betting on artificial general intelligence emergence
- Quantum Computing: 10-year horizon—positioning for quantum advantage
- AI Infrastructure: Current wave—picks-and-shovels plays (compute, data centers, chips)

**Style**: Thesis-driven, individual stock focus, small to large cap. Need methodology for vetting third-party ideas (ARK, analysts, etc.).

## Core Principles for Growth Tech Investing

### Understanding the Business (Lynch/Buffett)

1. **Two-Sentence Test**: Before buying, explain the business model and competitive moat in two sentences. If you can't, you don't understand it well enough. Your tech background is an edge—use it.

2. **Circle of Competence**: Stay within what you genuinely understand. AI/tech is your circle. Don't pretend to understand biotech or commodities just because they're "hot."

3. **Behind Every Stock Is a Business**: Stock prices fluctuate randomly short-term, but long-term there's 100% correlation between business success and stock success. Focus on the business.

4. **Lynch's Categories Matter**: Classify every stock—Fast Grower, Stalwart, Cyclical, Turnaround, or Asset Play. This determines your expectations and holding strategy.

### Valuation & Margin of Safety (Graham/Buffett)

5. **Margin of Safety for Growth Stocks**: For P/E > 30, calculate implied growth rate via reverse DCF. Require 20%+ buffer—if 25% growth is priced in, only buy if you believe 30%+ is achievable for 5+ years.

6. **PEG Ratio as Sanity Check**: P/E divided by growth rate. Under 1 = potentially undervalued. Over 2 = be skeptical. Over 3 = needs exceptional justification.

7. **Mr. Market Is Bipolar**: The market swings between euphoria and depression. Never sell just because price dropped—first ask if the business fundamentals changed. Use mood swings to your advantage.

8. **Price Is What You Pay, Value Is What You Get**: A great company at a terrible price is a terrible investment. Wait for your pitch.

### Identifying Winners (Lynch)

9. **Tenbagger Characteristics**: Look for scalable business models, durable competitive advantages, early in growth cycle, strong earnings trajectory, and reasonable valuation relative to growth.

10. **Fast Growers in Slow Industries = Gold**: The best tenbaggers are often 20-25% growers in mundane industries where competition is sleeping. In tech, look for this in overlooked niches.

11. **Insider Ownership Matters**: Management with significant skin in the game aligns incentives. Check proxy statements for insider holdings.

12. **Low Institutional Ownership = Opportunity**: If big funds haven't discovered it yet, you might have an edge. High institutional ownership means the story is well-known.

### Special Situations (Greenblatt)

13. **Spinoffs Create Inefficiency**: When companies separate divisions, institutions often sell indiscriminately. Look for: insider buying post-spin, forced selling by index funds, management incentives aligned.

14. **Restructurings Reveal Value**: When unprofitable divisions are cut, the remaining business's true profitability becomes visible. The stock often lags this reality.

15. **Follow the Forced Sellers**: Whenever large investors MUST sell (index rebalancing, fund redemptions, spinoffs), prices often overshoot. Be the buyer.

### Earnings Quality (O'Glove)

16. **Cash Flow Doesn't Lie**: If reported earnings aren't translating to operating cash flow, something's wrong. Always compare net income to CFO.

17. **Watch the Receivables**: A/R growing faster than revenue = potential revenue recognition games or collection problems. Major red flag.

18. **Acquisitions Can Hide Decay**: Companies growing primarily through M&A may be masking organic decline. Separate organic growth in your analysis.

19. **Trust But Verify**: Never blindly trust analysts or auditors. Their incentives may not align with yours. Do the work yourself.

### Risk Management (All)

20. **Position Size to Conviction**: High conviction + proven thesis = 5-15%. Speculative macro bet = 1-3%. Exploratory = 0.5-1%. Never bet the farm on unproven theses.

21. **Know Your Exit Before Entry**: Define what would make you sell BEFORE buying. Thesis broken? Valuation extreme? Better opportunity? Write it down.

22. **Diversification Has Limits**: Own only what you can track (8-15 positions for active investors). Overdiversification guarantees mediocrity.

23. **Time Is Your Friend**: It takes years, not months, for big winners. If 6 of 10 picks work, you're doing great. Let winners run.

## Decision Heuristics

### When Evaluating a Stock

- **P/E > 50**: Calculate implied growth rate. Is 40%+ annual growth realistic for 5 years? If not, wait for better price.
- **Revenue growing but cash burning**: Check path to profitability. Acceptable for early fast-growers, red flag for mature companies.
- **Stock down 30%+**: First question—did the business change or just the sentiment? Former = investigate, Latter = potential opportunity.
- **Insider selling**: Not always bad, but heavy selling by multiple insiders = investigate immediately.
- **Can't explain the moat**: If competitive advantage isn't obvious, assume there isn't one. Pass.

### When Vetting a Third-Party Thesis (ARK, Analysts)

- **Sounds exciting**: Ask who else believes this. If everyone agrees, it's probably priced in. Excitement ≠ opportunity.
- **Big TAM claims**: "This is a $500B market" means nothing. Who captures the value? What's the realistic market share?
- **Technology-first thinking**: Cool tech ≠ good investment. Ask: What's the business model? Who pays? What's the moat?
- **No bear case presented**: If the thesis doesn't address what could go wrong, it's incomplete. Do the bear case yourself.
- **Relies on "multiple expansion"**: If the thesis requires P/E to go UP, it's speculation. Good theses work even with multiple compression.

### When Developing a Macro Thesis

- **Map the value chain**: Who makes money if the thesis is right? Picks-and-shovels often beat direct bets.
- **Consider second-order effects**: AGI happens → compute demand explodes → power generation matters → data center cooling matters.
- **Define proof points**: What evidence would validate or invalidate? Set up monitoring.
- **Set timeline and revisit**: 5-year thesis should be reassessed annually. Don't fall in love with outdated views.

### When Managing Positions

- **Winner growing to 15%+ of portfolio**: Consider trimming, but don't sell just because it's big. Reevaluate thesis strength.
- **Thesis intact but stock down**: Potentially add, but only if you'd buy it fresh today at this price.
- **You can't remember why you own it**: Sell. If you don't know the thesis, you can't manage the position.
