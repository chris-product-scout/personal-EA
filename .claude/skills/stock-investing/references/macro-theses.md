Framework for developing, validating, and monitoring investment theses around major technology trends.

---

## Your Active Theses

### Thesis 1: AGI (5-Year Horizon)
**Core Belief**: Artificial General Intelligence will emerge within 5 years, creating massive value shifts in the technology landscape.

### Thesis 2: Quantum Computing (10-Year Horizon)
**Core Belief**: Quantum computing will achieve practical advantage for specific problem classes within 10 years.

### Thesis 3: AI Infrastructure (Current)
**Core Belief**: The current AI wave requires massive infrastructure buildout—compute, data centers, networking, power.

---

## Thesis Development Framework

### Step 1: Define the Core Claim

Answer these questions:

1. **What is the thesis in one sentence?**
   Example: "AGI will arrive within 5 years and reshape every industry."

2. **What is the timeline?**
   - Near-term: 1-2 years
   - Medium-term: 3-5 years
   - Long-term: 5-10+ years

3. **What needs to be true for this to happen?**
   List 3-5 key assumptions.

4. **What's the confidence level?**
   - High conviction (>70% probability)
   - Medium conviction (40-70%)
   - Speculative (<40%)

### Step 2: Map the Value Chain

**Who makes money if the thesis is correct?**

| Layer | Description | Examples | Risk Profile |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Enabling** | Foundational infrastructure | Chips, power, cooling | Lower risk, clear beneficiaries |
| **Platform** | Tools and services | Cloud, ML platforms | Medium risk |
| **Application** | End-user products | AI apps, enterprise tools | Higher risk, winner uncertain |
| **Services** | Implementation/consulting | Integrators, consultants | Late-cycle beneficiary |

**Key Questions:**
- Which layer captures the most value?
- Who has pricing power?
- Where are the bottlenecks?
- What's the "picks and shovels" play?

---

### Step 3: Identify Investment Categories

For each thesis, categorize potential investments:

#### Direct Plays
Companies directly building or benefiting from the technology.
- Higher potential upside
- Higher execution risk
- Valuation often stretched

#### Picks and Shovels
Companies selling tools/infrastructure to the builders.
- More predictable revenue
- Less dependent on "who wins"
- Often better risk/reward

#### Second-Order Effects
Companies benefiting from consequences of the trend.
- Less obvious, potentially undervalued
- Requires deeper analysis
- May take longer to play out

#### Shorts/Avoids
Companies disrupted if the thesis is correct.
- Potential hedges
- Validate thesis by understanding losers

---

### Step 4: Assess If Priced In

**The critical question: Does the market already believe this?**

**Signs it's priced in:**
- Massive valuations on unprofitable companies
- High P/S and P/E multiples across the sector
- Heavy retail and media interest
- Every analyst has a bull thesis
- ARK and similar funds are overweight

**Signs it's NOT priced in:**
- Skepticism from mainstream investors
- Reasonable valuations despite growth
- Limited analyst coverage
- Institutions underweight

**How to check:**
1. Look at sector/company valuations vs. historical
2. Read analyst sentiment—consensus or controversy?
3. Check fund flows into related ETFs
4. Assess retail interest (social media, search trends)

---

### Step 5: Define Proof Points

**What evidence would validate the thesis?**

Create a monitoring checklist:

| Proof Point | Target | Current | Status |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| [Key metric 1] | [Target] | [Current] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| [Key metric 2] | [Target] | [Current] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| [Key metric 3] | [Target] | [Current] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |

**Example for AGI Thesis:**
- Benchmark scores (MMLU, ARC-AGI, etc.)
- Capability breakthroughs announced
- Enterprise adoption metrics
- Compute/training cost trends
- Regulatory developments

---

### Step 6: Define Invalidation Criteria

**What would prove the thesis wrong?**

Be specific:
- "If [X] doesn't happen by [date], thesis is weakened"
- "If [metric] shows [pattern], reconsider position"
- "If [competitor/alternative] gains traction, reassess"

**Important**: Write these down BEFORE investing. Confirmation bias is real.

---

### Step 7: Position Sizing

| Thesis Conviction | Thesis Timeline | Suggested Allocation |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| High | Near-term | 15-25% of portfolio |
| High | Medium-term | 10-20% |
| High | Long-term | 5-15% |
| Medium | Any | 5-10% |
| Speculative | Any | 2-5% |

**Within a thesis, diversify:**
- Don't put entire thesis allocation in one stock
- Mix direct plays and picks-and-shovels
- Consider different risk profiles

## AGI Thesis Deep Dive

### Core Assumptions
1. Scaling laws continue to hold
2. Compute costs continue declining
3. No fundamental barriers to AGI emerge
4. Regulatory environment remains permissive enough

### Value Chain Map

| Layer | Players | Investment Angle |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Compute** | NVIDIA, AMD, custom ASICs | Picks & shovels—clear beneficiary |
| **Cloud/Training** | Hyperscalers (MSFT, GOOG, AMZN) | Platform layer, diversified |
| **Model Builders** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | Mostly private, hard to access |
| **Infrastructure** | Data centers, power, cooling | Second-order, often overlooked |
| **Applications** | TBD—winner unclear | High risk, high reward |

### Key Proof Points to Monitor
- [ ] Model capability benchmarks (quarterly)
- [ ] Major capability announcements
- [ ] Enterprise AI spending growth
- [ ] NVIDIA/AMD earnings (demand signal)
- [ ] Hyperscaler capex guidance

### Invalidation Signals
- Scaling laws plateau without capability breakthroughs
- Major safety incidents cause regulatory crackdown
- Compute costs stop declining
- 3+ years without significant capability jumps

## Quantum Computing Thesis Deep Dive

### Core Assumptions
1. Error correction improves sufficiently
2. Qubit counts scale meaningfully
3. Specific use cases prove commercial value
4. Talent and funding continue flowing

### Value Chain Map

| Layer | Players | Investment Angle |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Hardware** | IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, IBM | Pure plays, high risk |
| **Cloud Access** | AWS, Azure, Google | Diversified exposure |
| **Software/Algorithms** | Early stage, mostly private | Hard to access |
| **Use Cases** | Pharma, finance, materials | Long-dated beneficiaries |

### Current State (As of Research Date)
- IonQ: Trapped ion approach, ~$100M revenue guidance
- D-Wave: Quantum annealing, most commercial deployments
- Rigetti: Superconducting, smaller scale

### Key Proof Points to Monitor
- [ ] Qubit count and error rate milestones
- [ ] Commercial contract announcements
- [ ] Government funding commitments
- [ ] Breakthrough algorithm developments
- [ ] Major tech company quantum investments

### Invalidation Signals
- No meaningful error correction progress in 3 years
- Major players (Google, IBM) deprioritize efforts
- Classical computing advances make quantum less necessary
- Funding dries up for pure-play companies

### Position Sizing Warning
Quantum pure-plays trade at extreme valuations (200-300x sales). Position size should be small (1-2% max) given:
- Binary outcome risk
- Long timeline
- Execution uncertainty
- Valuation risk

### Invalidation Signals
- Hyperscalers cut capex guidance
- AI model efficiency gains reduce compute needs faster than expected
- Enterprise AI adoption stalls
- GPU oversupply develops

## Vetting Third-Party Theses

When someone (ARK, analyst, podcast) presents a thesis:

### Quick Filter Questions
1. **What's their track record?** (ARK has been wrong on timing despite good thesis ideas)
2. **What are they NOT saying?** (Bull cases always omit bear scenarios)
3. **Who disagrees and why?** (Find the smartest bear)
4. **Is this already consensus?** (If so, probably priced in)

### Deep Analysis
1. Map their thesis to your framework above
2. Do your own value chain analysis
3. Identify their assumptions—are they reasonable?
4. Calculate what's priced in at current valuations
5. Define your own proof points and invalidation criteria

### ARK-Specific Considerations
- **Strength**: Good at identifying long-term trends early
- **Weakness**: Often wrong on timing, valuations stretched
- **Pattern**: Their theses often play out but stocks can drop 50-80% first
- **Lesson**: Thesis quality ≠ investment timing. Apply margin of safety.
