# Stock Evaluation Checklist

Systematic framework for analyzing individual stocks. Work through each section in order.

## Step 1: Initial Classification

**What type of stock is this?** (Lynch's Categories)

| Category | Characteristics | Your Expectations |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Fast Grower** | 20-50%+ revenue growth, smaller company | Tenbagger potential, higher risk |
| **Stalwart** | 10-20% growth, large established company | Steady compounder, lower risk |
| **Cyclical** | Tied to economic/industry cycles | Timing matters, buy low in cycle |
| **Turnaround** | Beaten down, potential recovery | High risk/reward, catalyst needed |
| **Asset Play** | Hidden value in assets/IP | Requires deep analysis |
| **Slow Grower** | <10% growth, mature | Dividend focus, limited upside |

**For growth tech, you're usually looking at**: Fast Growers or Stalwarts

## Step 2: Business Understanding

**The Two-Sentence Test**

Can you complete these sentences?

1. "[Company] makes money by ________________________________."

2. "Their competitive advantage is ________________________________."

**If you can't fill these in clearly, STOP. Do more research or pass.**

**Key Questions:**

- [ ] What problem do they solve?
- [ ] Who are the customers? (Enterprise, SMB, Consumer)
- [ ] What's the revenue model? (Subscription, transaction, licensing, ads)
- [ ] What's the gross margin profile? (High = software, Low = hardware)
- [ ] Is revenue recurring or one-time?

## Step 3: Competitive Moat Analysis

**What protects this business?**

| Moat Type | Description | Durability | Tech Examples |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Network Effects** | More users = more value | Very High | Meta, Uber, marketplaces |
| **Switching Costs** | Painful to leave | High | Salesforce, enterprise SaaS |
| **Cost Advantages** | Lowest cost producer | Medium | TSMC, scale players |
| **Intangible Assets** | Patents, brands, licenses | Varies | Qualcomm, NVIDIA (CUDA) |
| **Efficient Scale** | Market only supports few players | Medium-High | Cloud hyperscalers |

**Assessment:**

- [ ] What type of moat exists?
- [ ] How durable is it? (1-10 scale)
- [ ] Is the moat widening or narrowing?
- [ ] Who are the main competitors?
- [ ] What would it take to disrupt them?

---

## Step 4: Management Quality

**The Buffett Test:**

- [ ] Is management rational in capital allocation?
- [ ] Are they candid in shareholder communications? (Read earnings call transcripts)
- [ ] Do they resist "institutional imperative" (herd behavior)?

**Skin in the Game:**

- [ ] What % of shares do insiders own?
- [ ] Are they buying or selling? (Check SEC Form 4)
- [ ] Are incentives aligned with shareholders?

**Red Flags:**

- [ ] Frequent CFO changes
- [ ] Aggressive accounting or guidance patterns
- [ ] Empire building through bad acquisitions
- [ ] Excessive executive compensation vs. performance

## Step 5: Financial Health

### Growth Metrics

| Metric | What to Look For | Red Flag |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Revenue Growth | 20%+ for fast growers | Decelerating without explanation |
| Revenue vs. Expectations | Consistent beats | Frequent misses |
| Growth Durability | Multi-year runway | One-time boost |

### Profitability Metrics

| Metric | Target (Tech) | Red Flag |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Gross Margin | >70% SaaS, >50% other | Declining margins |
| Operating Margin | Improving trajectory | Flat despite scale |
| Net Income vs. Cash Flow | Should be similar | Big divergence |

### Balance Sheet Health

| Metric | What to Check | Red Flag |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Cash Position | Runway for 2+ years | <12 months cash |
| Debt/Equity | Reasonable for sector | Rapidly increasing |
| Current Ratio | >1.5 preferred | <1.0 danger |

### Cash Flow Quality

- [ ] Is Operating Cash Flow positive (or path to positive)?
- [ ] OCF vs. Net Income—are they similar? (If not, why?)
- [ ] Free Cash Flow margin—what's the trend?
- [ ] Cash conversion cycle—is it improving?

## Step 6: SaaS-Specific Metrics (If Applicable)

| Metric | Elite | Good | Concerning |
|--------|-------|------|------------|
| **Rule of 40** (Growth + Margin) | >50% | 40%+ | <25% |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | >130% | >110% | <100% |
| **Gross Margin** | >80% | >70% | <60% |
| **CAC Payback** | <12 mo | <18 mo | >24 mo |
| **LTV/CAC** | >5x | >3x | <2x |

---

## Step 7: Valuation Assessment

### Basic Metrics

| Metric | How to Use |
|--------|------------|
| **P/E Ratio** | Compare to growth rate and peers |
| **P/S Ratio** | For unprofitable companies, compare to growth |
| **EV/Revenue** | Standard for SaaS, compare to Rule of 40 |
| **EV/EBITDA** | For profitable companies |
| **PEG Ratio** | P/E ÷ Growth Rate; <1 = cheap, >2 = expensive |

### Implied Growth Analysis

For high P/E stocks, calculate what's "priced in":

1. Current P/E = [X]
2. Assume terminal P/E of 20-25 in 5 years
3. Back-calculate required annual EPS growth
4. Ask: Is this growth rate achievable?

**Margin of Safety Check:**

- [ ] What growth is priced in?
- [ ] Is that growth rate realistic for 5+ years?
- [ ] What happens if growth is 20% lower than expected?
- [ ] Is there a margin of safety or priced for perfection?

## Step 8: Thesis & Macro Fit

**How does this fit your investment theses?**

- [ ] AGI thesis: Does this benefit from AGI development?
- [ ] Quantum thesis: Is this positioned for quantum computing?
- [ ] AI Infrastructure: Is this a picks-and-shovels play?
- [ ] Other thesis: ________________________________

**Where in the value chain?**

- [ ] Enabling layer (chips, infrastructure)
- [ ] Platform layer (cloud, tools)
- [ ] Application layer (end-user products)
- [ ] Services layer (implementation, consulting)

---

## Step 9: Risk Assessment

**What could go wrong?**

- [ ] Competitive threats (new entrants, big tech, etc.)
- [ ] Technology obsolescence risk
- [ ] Customer concentration risk
- [ ] Regulatory risk
- [ ] Key person risk
- [ ] Macro/cycle risk

**Bear Case:**

Write the bear case in 2-3 sentences:
_________________________________________________
