## January 9, 2026: The AI Revolution Roundtable

**Source**: The Substack Post
**Participants**: Michael Burry, Jack Clark (Anthropic), Dwarkesh Patel, Patrick McKenzie (moderator)
**Topic**: Is AI the real deal, or a historic misallocation of capital?

### Full Conversation Summary

#### The Story of AI (Context)

**Jack Clark** on what happened since 2017:
- In 2017, the bet was on training agents from scratch on curricula of hard tasks (AlphaGo, Dota 2, Starcraft)
- This "tabula rasa" approach created superhuman agents within specific task distributions but NOT general intelligence
- The breakthrough came from large-scale pre-training on datasets + Transformers + Scaling Laws
- Now things are coming full circle: agents built on top of pre-trained models (like Claude Code)

**Patrick McKenzie** key insight:
> "No further development on AI capabilities will ever need to be built on a worse cognitive substrate than what we currently have. 'What you see today is the floor, not the ceiling' is one of the things best understood by insiders and worst understood by policymakers."

**Michael Burry** surprises:
1. Google wasn't leading the whole way despite having everything (Search, Android, the LLM, the chips)
2. Expected ASICs and SLMs to be dominant by now - surprised Nvidia maintained dominance into inference era
3. ChatGPT (a chatbot) kicked off trillions in spending - disproportionate response

#### Do AI Tools Actually Improve Productivity?

**Key Tension**: Self-reported productivity gains vs actual measured productivity

**Jack Clark**: Anthropic internal survey showed 50% self-reported productivity boost from developers using Claude.

**Dwarkesh Patel**: But the METR study showed developers working in codebases they understood well had ~20% DECREASE in pull request merge times with coding tools.

**Jack Clark** acknowledged: "What people self-report may end up being different from reality."

**Implication**: Be skeptical of productivity claims. The data is conflicting.

---

#### Which Company Is Winning?

**Consensus**: More competitive than ever. No clear winner.

**Michael Burry**:
> "The secret to Google search was always how cheap it was... I think this is the fundamental problem with generative AI and LLMs today—they are so expensive. It is hard to understand what the profit model is."

**Dwarkesh**: Gains from inference scaling require exponential increase in variable costs.

**Implication**: Margin pressure is real. The "commodity economy" Burry predicts favors whoever runs cheapest.

---

#### Why Hasn't AI Stolen All Jobs?

**Dwarkesh Patel**:
> "If you showed me Gemini 3 or Claude 4.5 Opus in 2017, I would have thought it would put half of white-collar workers out of their jobs. And yet the labor market impact of AI requires spreadsheet microscopes to see, if there is indeed any."

**Jack Clark** on why AI is "jagged":
- LLMs scored "superhuman" on hard cognitive benchmarks but couldn't self-correct errors
- Weaknesses are unintuitive and discovered alongside massive improvements

**Implication**: Don't assume job displacement = immediate. Adoption is slower than capability.

---

#### Why Many Workers Aren't Using AI Yet

**Jack Clark** on why coding leads:
- Coding is "closed loop" - generate code, validate, push to production
- Other domains lacked this until tools like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and web search
- Now friction is being removed for knowledge workers broadly

**Prediction**: "We're about to see what happened to coders happen to knowledge workers more broadly."

#### Burry's Core Economic Argument

**The Escalator Problem**:
> "Warren Buffett owned a department store in the late 1960s. When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out."

**Infrastructure-to-Application Ratio**:
> "Nvidia selling $400 billion of chips for less than $100 billion in end-user AI product revenue... This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning."

**The Arithmetic Constraint**:
> "Economies don't have magically expanding pies. They have arithmetically constrained pies. The entire software pie—SaaS software—is less than $1 trillion."

**Deflationary Risk**:
> "If AI replaces a $500 seat license with a $50 one, that is great for productivity but is deflationary for productivity spend. And that productivity gained is likely to be shared by all competitors."

---

#### On Engineers and Headcount

**Michael Burry** on headcount as the wrong metric:
- Microsoft added 18,000 employees 2000-2014 while stock went nowhere
- Track **ROIC** (Return on Invested Capital) instead
- ROIC was very high at software companies; now falling fast as they become capital-intensive hardware companies
- "Nothing predicts long-term trends in markets like the direction of ROIC—up or down, and at what speed."

**On Stock-Based Compensation**:
> "At Nvidia, I calculated that roughly half of its profit is eliminated by compensation linked to stock."

---

#### Where Is the Money Going?

**Burry on Hardware Obsolescence**:
> "Chips cycle every year now; data centers of today won't handle the chips of a few years from now. One could almost argue that a lot of this should be expensed, not capitalized. Or depreciated over two, three, four years."

**On Private Credit Risk**:
> "Private credit is financing this boom... the duration mismatch stands out—much of this is being securitized as if the assets last two decades, while giving the hyperscaler outs every four to five years. This is just asking for trouble. Stranded assets."

**On CIP (Construction in Progress) Accounting**:
> "Capital equipment not yet 'placed into service' does not start depreciating or counting against income. And it can be there forever. I imagine a lot of stranded assets will be hidden in CIP to protect income."

**The Nadella Quote**:
> "In Dwarkesh's interview, Nadella said he backed off some projects and slowed down the buildout because he did not want to get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation of chips. That is a bit of a smoking-gun statement."

**Burry's Timing Assessment**:
> "We are mid-cycle now—past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves."

---

#### Where Does Value Accrue?

**Burry's Framework**:
> "Value accrues, historically, in all industries, to those with a durable competitive advantage manifesting as either pricing power or an untouchable cost or distribution advantage. It is not clear that the spending here will lead to that."

**Dwarkesh's Counterpoint**:
> "If it does turn out that nobody across the AI stack can make crazy profits and AI still turns out to be a big deal, then the value accrues to the customer. Which, to my ears, sounds great."

**Burry's Agreement**:
> "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged."

---

#### Burry on Specific Stocks

**Most Wrong About**: Nvidia and Palantir

**On Nvidia**:
> "Nvidia's advantage is not durable. SLMs and ASICs are the future for most use cases in AI. They will be backward-compatible with CUDA if at all necessary. Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach."

**On Palantir**:
> "There are virtually no earnings after stock-based compensation."

---

#### What Would Change Their Minds

**Michael Burry** would recalibrate if:
1. Autonomous AI agents displace millions of jobs at biggest companies
2. Application-layer revenue hits $500 billion+ (proliferation of killer apps)

**Burry's Binary on Hardware**:
> "Right now, we will see one of two things: either Nvidia's chips last five to six years and people therefore need less of them, or they last two to three years and the hyperscalers' earnings will collapse and private credit will get destroyed."

**Dwarkesh Patel** would be surprised if:
1. 2026 cumulative AI lab revenues below $40B or above $100B
2. Continual learning is solved (model remembers context like a 6-month employee)
3. Timelines to AGI significantly narrow to 5-20 years

**Jack Clark** would be surprised if:
1. "Scaling hits a wall" - truly surprising with major implications
2. Distributed training breakthrough enables open model development without vast singular entities

#### How They Actually Use LLMs

**Michael Burry**:
> "I use Claude to produce all my charts and tables now... I still don't trust the numbers and need to check them."

**Patrick McKenzie**:
> "People outside of finance do not understand how many billions of dollars have been spent having some of the best-paid, best-educated people employed as Microsoft PowerPoint and Excel specialists."

**Dwarkesh Patel**:
> "They are now my personal one-on-one tutors. I've actually tried to hire human tutors for different subjects... the latency and speed of LLMs makes for a qualitatively much better experience."

**Michael Burry on Trades**:
> "Many point to trade careers as an AI-proof choice. Given how much I can now do in electrical work and other areas around the house just with Claude at my side, I am not so sure."

#### Risk, Power, and Policy

**Jack Clark's Main Worry**:
> "Whether people succeed at 'building AI that builds AI'—fully closing the loop on AI R&D (recursively self-improving AI)... would have extremely significant effects on the economy."

**Michael Burry's Policy Recommendation**:
> "Take a trillion dollars and bypass all the protests and regulations and dot the whole country with small nuclear reactors, while also building a brand-new, state-of-the-art grid for everyone... This is the only hope of getting enough power to keep up with China."

**Jack Clark's Agreement**:
> "AI will play a meaningful role in the economy, and it fundamentally depends on underlying infrastructure to deliver it efficiently and cheaply... We need to urgently do the same for energy."

### Key Takeaways for Investment Thesis

#### Supports Our Thesis:
1. **Power is critical** - Burry and Clark agree energy infrastructure is crucial → supports IREN thesis (power assets)
2. **Photonics as efficiency play** - Burry says NVIDIA is "power-hungry, dirty solution" → efficiency matters → photonics benefits
3. **Contracted revenue > speculation** - Burry's stranded assets concern → favor IREN (Microsoft contract) over speculative buildout

#### Challenges Our Thesis:
1. **"Mid-cycle" timing** - May be past point where stocks reward further buildout
2. **Escalator problem** - AI may not create durable competitive advantages
3. **ROIC compression** - Hyperscalers becoming hardware companies = lower returns
