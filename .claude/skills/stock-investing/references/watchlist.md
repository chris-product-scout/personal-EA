## Active Macro Theses

### Thesis 1: AI Infrastructure Buildout (NOW - 2027)
**Core Belief**: AI training and inference require massive infrastructure. Companies providing power, compute, and connectivity benefit regardless of which AI lab wins.

**Value Chain**:
1. Power/Real Estate (IREN, CIFR) - Selling capacity to hyperscalers
2. Chips (NVIDIA, AMD, custom ASICs) - Compute layer
3. Interconnects/Photonics (COHR, LITE, POET) - Data movement layer
4. Networking (Arista, Ciena) - Infrastructure layer

**Key Concern (Burry, Jan 2026)**: Infrastructure-to-application ratio is 4:1 ($400B chips vs $100B AI revenue). Spending may be disconnected from returns. "Mid-cycle" - stocks may not reward further buildout.

**Monitoring**: Hyperscaler capex guidance (earnings calls), AI application revenue growth

### Thesis 2: Photonics/Optical Interconnects (2025-2028)
**Core Belief**: Electrical interconnects (copper) are hitting physical limits. 1.6T transition in 2026-2027 requires optical solutions. This is physics, not hype.

**Why It's Durable**: Even if NVIDIA GPUs get displaced by ASICs (Burry's prediction), ASICs still need optical interconnects. Photonics is beneath the GPU vs ASIC battle.

**Key Catalyst**: 1.6T transition (2026-2027)

### Thesis 3: Defense Drones & Counter-UAS (2025-2030)
**Core Belief**: Ukraine changed warfare doctrine. Pentagon shifting from expensive platforms (F-35) to attritable mass (cheap drones). NDAA bans create forced replacement of Chinese drones.

**Separate from AI thesis** - driven by geopolitics, not AI spending.

## Watchlist: AI Infrastructure / HPC

### IREN (Iris Energy) - PRIORITY

**Category**: Fast Grower (Bitcoin miner pivoted to AI/HPC)

**The Business**: Former Bitcoin miner with cheap power contracts and data center infrastructure. Pivoted to leasing GPU compute capacity to hyperscalers.

**Key Contract**: $9.7B, 5-year Microsoft deal (signed late 2025)
- Deploying 76,000 NVIDIA GB300 GPUs
- Target: $3.4B ARR by end of 2026
- 85% EBITDA margins on AI contracts

**Financials (Q1 FY26 - Sept 2025)**:
- Revenue: $240M (+355% YoY)
- Net Income: $384M (was -$51M loss)
- Cash: $1B

**Bull Case**:
- Contracted revenue provides visibility
- Microsoft deal validates execution capability
- Power assets are scarce; hard to replicate
- Trading at ~4.7x forward EBITDA if targets hit

**Bear Case**:
- Technology risk: What if NVIDIA GPUs become obsolete? Does Microsoft still need IREN's capacity?
- Execution risk: Scaling from 23K to 140K GPUs is hard
- Post-contract risk: What happens after Microsoft deal ends?
- Still has Bitcoin exposure (~10% of business)

**Burry Concern**: Stranded assets, chip obsolescence, "mid-cycle" timing

**Position Sizing**: 2-3% (Medium conviction, contracted but execution-dependent)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Already actionable at current levels
- Better entry on 20%+ pullback

**Exit Criteria (SELL IF)**:
- [ ] Microsoft contract shows signs of trouble (delays, renegotiation)
- [ ] Hyperscaler capex guidance gets cut >20%
- [ ] Miss GPU deployment milestones by >6 months
- [ ] Management turnover (CEO/CFO departure)
- [ ] Bitcoin exposure increases significantly

**Quarterly Monitoring**:
- [ ] GPU deployment progress (target: 140K by end 2026)
- [ ] Revenue vs $3.4B ARR target
- [ ] Microsoft relationship health
- [ ] New contract announcements
- [ ] Bitcoin mining as % of revenue (should be declining)

### CIFR (Cipher Mining) - WATCH

**Category**: Fast Grower (Bitcoin miner pivoting to AI/HPC)

**The Business**: Similar to IREN - Bitcoin miner pivoting to AI data centers.

**Key Contracts**:
- $5.5B AWS deal (15-year, 300MW)
- $3B Fluidstack deal (Google backstop)
- Total: ~$8.5B contracted

**Key Difference from IREN**: Revenue doesn't start until late 2026. IREN is 12-18 months ahead.

**Financials**:
- Market cap: ~$6.4B (half of IREN)
- Still projecting losses through 2026 (-$0.88/share)
- $1.21B cash vs $1.04B obligations

**Why It's Riskier Than IREN**:
- Later revenue ramp = more exposed to spending pullback
- If hyperscaler capex gets cut in 2026, CIFR is more vulnerable
- Trading at 7x 2027 sales with no near-term catalysts

**Position Sizing**: 1-2% (Speculative - wait for validation)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Wait for AWS revenue to begin (late 2026)
- Or significant pullback (30%+) creating better risk/reward

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] AWS or Fluidstack contract cancellation/delay
- [ ] Failure to hit Phase I milestones
- [ ] Hyperscaler capex cuts

**Quarterly Monitoring**:
- [ ] AWS delivery timeline (July 2026 target)
- [ ] Fluidstack Phase I delivery (Sept 2026 target)
- [ ] New contract announcements
- [ ] Cash burn rate

## Watchlist: Photonics / Optical

### COHR (Coherent) - PRIORITY

**Category**: Fast Grower / Cyclical

**The Business**: Vertically integrated optical components. Makes wafers, lasers, and finished transceiver modules. Volume leader with ~25% market share.

**Why It's Preferred Over LITE**:
- Better valuation: 4.25x sales vs LITE's 9.18x
- First mover on 1.6T transceivers
- Vertical integration = margin control + supply chain security
- Manufacturing scale for hyperscaler volumes

**Financials (Q1 FY26)**:
- Revenue: $1.58B (+17.3% YoY)
- EPS: $1.16 (beat by $0.12)
- Strong AI data center demand

**Bull Case**:
- 1.6T transition is a replacement cycle - everyone needs new equipment
- Vertically integrated = better margins
- Burry's efficiency concerns SUPPORT photonics thesis
- Less stretched valuation than LITE

**Bear Case**:
- Cyclical business - can pull back sharply
- Competition from Intel, TSMC internal efforts
- Customer concentration (hyperscalers have buying power)

**Position Sizing**: 2-3% (Medium-High conviction)

**Entry Criteria**: Actionable now; better on 15%+ pullback

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] Gross margins compress below 35%
- [ ] 1.6T transition stalls or delays significantly
- [ ] Major customer loss
- [ ] Competitor leapfrogs on technology

**Quarterly Monitoring**:
- [ ] 1.6T transceiver revenue ramp
- [ ] Gross margin trend

### LITE (Lumentum) - WATCH

**Category**: Fast Grower

**The Business**: Leading supplier of EML lasers for 800G/1.6T transceivers. "Selling gunpowder to everyone" - even if a competitor wins a transceiver contract, they often buy lasers from Lumentum.

**The Moat**: EML laser technology. High-speed optical modules require EMLs for signal integrity. Lumentum dominates this.

**Concern**: Up 372% in 2025. Valuation stretched at 9.18x sales.

**Position Sizing**: 1-2% (Wait for pullback)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Wait for 25-30% pullback from highs
- Or evidence that growth is re-accelerating

**Quarterly Monitoring**:
- [ ] Revenue growth rate (currently 58%, expected to decelerate to 32%, then 15%)
- [ ] EML market share
- [ ] Gross margin stability

---

### POET Technologies - SPECULATIVE

**Category**: Asset Play / Turnaround

**The Business**: Novel silicon photonics approach. Optical Interposer technology claims 70% lower power, 50% fewer lasers, 90% less labor.

**The Thesis**: If their manufacturing approach works at scale, massive upside. Partnerships with Foxconn, Luxshare, Mitsubishi provide validation.

**The Risk**: Pre-revenue, competing against Intel/AMD/TSMC with massive R&D budgets. "Next NVIDIA" narratives rarely pan out.

**Financials**:
- $150M cash, no debt
- $5.6M in production orders (tiny)
- $9.4M Q3 2025 loss

**Position Sizing**: 0.5-1% MAX (Lottery ticket)

**Entry Criteria**: Small position only; don't chase

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] Cash runway drops below 18 months
- [ ] Key partnership (Foxconn, etc.) terminates
- [ ] Technology validation fails

**Quarterly Monitoring**:
- [ ] Production order pipeline
- [ ] 1.6T/3.2T development progress
- [ ] Cash burn rate

## Watchlist: Defense Drones

### KTOS (Kratos Defense) - PRIORITY

**Category**: Fast Grower

**The Business**: Defense contractor focused on tactical UAVs, "Loyal Wingman" autonomous jets (XQ-58A Valkyrie), and aerial targets.

**Why It's Preferred Over ONDS**:
- More scale: $1.6B 2026 revenue target vs ONDS $110M
- Proven contracts with Pentagon
- "Loyal Wingman" thesis is hot ($4M Valkyrie vs $80M F-35)
- Less speculative than ONDS

**Position Sizing**: 2-3% (Medium conviction)

**Entry Criteria**: Actionable now

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] Major program cancellation
- [ ] Defense budget cuts
- [ ] Key contract losses

**Quarterly Monitoring**:
- [ ] Contract wins/backlog
- [ ] Valkyrie program progress
- [ ] Revenue vs $1.6B 2026 target

---

### ONDS (Ondas Holdings) - SPECULATIVE

**Category**: Fast Grower (Early Stage)

**The Business**: Autonomous drones (Optimus), counter-UAS systems (Iron Drone), ground robots.

**The Thesis**: NDAA-compliant drone provider replacing Chinese drones. FAA Type Certification is a moat. Government border drone contract.

**The Risk**: Tiny revenue base ($36M 2025). Pre-profit. Trading at high multiple to current revenue.

**Financials**:
- Q3 2025 revenue: $10M (+500% YoY)
- 2026 target: $110M
- Still losing money (~$7.5M/quarter)

**Braudy's View**: "10-20x in 4 years" - requires everything going right

**Position Sizing**: 1% MAX (High speculation)

**Entry Criteria**: Wait for pullback; don't chase after 281% 2025 run

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] Miss 2026 revenue targets significantly
- [ ] Key contract cancellation
- [ ] Cash runway concerns

**Quarterly Monitoring**:
- [ ] Revenue vs $110M 2026 target
- [ ] New contract announcements

## Key Insights Log

### January 2026: Burry/Clark/Patel Roundtable

**Source**: The Substack Post (Jan 9, 2026)

**Burry's Key Points**:
1. Infrastructure-to-application ratio is 4:1 - spending disconnected from revenue
2. "Escalator problem" - AI won't create durable competitive advantage for most
3. Chips cycle yearly; data centers may become stranded assets
4. ROIC is collapsing at hyperscalers as they become hardware companies
5. "Mid-cycle" - past point where stocks reward further buildout
6. NVIDIA's advantage not durable; ASICs and SLMs are the future
7. Private credit financing has dangerous duration mismatch

**Jack Clark's Counter**:
- AI capabilities improving rapidly - "this is the worst it will ever be"
- Coding tools showing massive uptake = real value
- Self-improving AI is a wildcard that could change everything

**Implication for Portfolio**:
- Favor contracted revenue (IREN) over speculative buildout (CIFR)
- Photonics thesis actually STRENGTHENED by efficiency concerns
- Defense drone thesis is separate - unaffected
