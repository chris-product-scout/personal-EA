# Financial Red Flags & Earnings Quality

Based on Thornton O'Glove's "Quality of Earnings" framework. Use this to identify warning signs that reported earnings may not reflect true business performance.

---

## The Core Principle

**Not all earnings are created equal.** Companies can manipulate reported earnings through accounting choices, timing, and accruals. Cash flow from operations is the most reliable metric because cash is hard to fake.

**The Golden Rule**: If reported earnings aren't translating to operating cash flow, investigate immediately.

## Critical Red Flags (Investigate Immediately)

### 1. Accounts Receivable Growing Faster Than Revenue

**What it means**: Company may be:
- Recognizing revenue before it's earned ("stuffing the channel")
- Having collection problems
- Offering extended payment terms to make sales

**How to check**:
- Calculate A/R growth rate vs. revenue growth rate
- Look at Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) trend
- Compare to industry peers

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL if A/R growth exceeds revenue growth by >10% for multiple quarters

---

### 2. Inventory Growing Faster Than Sales

**What it means**:
- Products not selling
- Obsolescence risk building
- Future write-downs likely

**How to check**:
- Calculate inventory growth vs. revenue growth
- Look at inventory turnover trend
- Check for inventory write-downs in recent quarters

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL for hardware/product companies; less relevant for pure software

---

### 3. Cash Flow ≠ Reported Earnings

**What it means**:
- Accounting tricks inflating earnings
- Aggressive revenue recognition
- Expense timing manipulation

**How to check**:
- Compare Net Income to Operating Cash Flow
- They should be in the same ballpark over time
- Large persistent gaps = investigate

**Calculation**: CFO / Net Income ratio
- Healthy: 0.8 - 1.2
- Warning: <0.7 or >1.5 persistently
- Danger: <0.5 or negative CFO with positive NI

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL—this is the #1 check for earnings quality

---

### 4. Frequent CFO or Auditor Changes

**What it means**:
- Internal disagreements about accounting
- Potential cover-up of problems
- Someone saw something they didn't like

**How to check**:
- Look at 8-K filings for executive departures
- Check for auditor change disclosures
- Read the stated reasons carefully

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL—multiple changes in 2-3 years is a major red flag

---

## Serious Red Flags (Dig Deeper)

### 5. Declining Gross Margins

**What it means**:
- Competitive pressure
- Loss of pricing power
- Cost structure problems

**How to check**:
- Track gross margin over 8+ quarters
- Compare to competitors
- Read management's explanation

**Severity**: 🟠 SERIOUS—sustainable margin compression destroys value

---

### 6. Interest Expense Rising as % of Operating Income

**What it means**:
- Debt becoming less manageable
- May require dilution or more debt to service
- Financial flexibility shrinking

**How to check**:
- Interest coverage ratio (EBIT / Interest) trend
- Should be stable or improving
- <3x is concerning, <2x is dangerous

**Severity**: 🟠 SERIOUS—eventually becomes existential

---

### 7. Growth Primarily Through Acquisitions

**What it means**:
- May be hiding organic decline
- Integration risks
- Goodwill impairment risk

**How to check**:
- Separate organic vs. acquired revenue growth
- Look at M&A track record
- Check goodwill as % of total assets

**Severity**: 🟠 SERIOUS—especially if organic growth is flat or negative

---

### 8. Tax Rate Discrepancies

**What it means**:
- Strong profits but low taxes = possible manipulation
- Using deferred taxes, loss carryforwards, or expense shifting

**How to check**:
- Compare effective tax rate to statutory rate
- Look at cash taxes paid vs. tax expense
- Persistent differences warrant investigation

**Severity**: 🟠 SERIOUS—tax tricks eventually catch up

---

### 9. Rising Stock-Based Compensation

**What it means**:
- Real cost being ignored in "adjusted" metrics
- Shareholder dilution
- Management enrichment

**How to check**:
- SBC as % of revenue (>15% is high for mature companies)
- SBC growth vs. revenue growth
- Fully diluted share count trend

**Severity**: 🟠 SERIOUS—this is real cash out of shareholders' pockets

---

## Warning Signs (Monitor Closely)

### 10. Aggressive Non-GAAP Adjustments

**What it means**:
- Company wants you to ignore real expenses
- Creating "fantasy" profitability metrics

**How to check**:
- Compare GAAP to non-GAAP earnings
- Read what's being adjusted out
- "Adjusted EBITDA" adding back stock comp, restructuring = skepticism warranted

**Severity**: 🟡 WARNING—not inherently bad but requires scrutiny

---

### 11. Deferred Revenue Changes

**What it means**:
- Declining deferred revenue in SaaS = slowing future growth
- Large deferred revenue build-up may indicate rev rec issues

**How to check**:
- Deferred revenue growth vs. revenue growth
- For SaaS: should track subscription growth
- Sudden changes in either direction = investigate

**Severity**: 🟡 WARNING—context matters

---

### 12. Related Party Transactions

**What it means**:
- Potential conflicts of interest
- Unusual business arrangements
- Self-dealing risk

**How to check**:
- Read proxy statement carefully
- Look for transactions with insiders
- Question any large related-party dealings

**Severity**: 🟡 WARNING—not always bad but requires disclosure scrutiny

---

### 13. Capitalized Expenses

**What it means**:
- Moving expenses to the balance sheet to boost current earnings
- Common areas: software development, customer acquisition

**How to check**:
- Look at capitalized software/development costs
- Compare capex/revenue ratio to peers
- Sudden changes in capitalization policy = red flag

**Severity**: 🟡 WARNING—can hide true expense levels

---

### 14. Unusual Revenue Recognition Timing

**What it means**:
- Pulling forward revenue
- Quarter-end loading (hockey stick patterns)

**How to check**:
- Look at quarterly seasonality patterns
- Big Q4 vs. Q1 swings
- Revenue concentration in last month of quarter

**Severity**: 🟡 WARNING—may indicate desperation to hit numbers
