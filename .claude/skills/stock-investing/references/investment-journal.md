## 2026 Decisions

### January 10, 2026 - RESEARCH SESSION: Braudy Stock Tips

**Source**: Text messages from Braudy + Twitter influencers (@Agrippa_Inv, @sunxliao, @mikealfred)

**Stocks Researched**: IREN, CIFR, ONDS, POET, LITE, COHR, KTOS

**Key Findings**:

1. **AI Infrastructure Sector (IREN, CIFR)**
   - Bitcoin miners pivoting to AI/HPC data centers
   - IREN has $9.7B Microsoft contract - best positioned
   - CIFR has $8.5B in contracts but revenue starts later (late 2026)
   - Thesis: Hyperscalers desperate for compute, miners have power + real estate

2. **Photonics Sector (LITE, COHR, POET)**
   - Copper interconnects hitting physical limits
   - 1.6T transition in 2026-2027 is the catalyst
   - COHR preferred over LITE (better valuation, first-mover on 1.6T)
   - POET is speculative (pre-revenue, lottery ticket)

3. **Defense Drones (KTOS, ONDS)**
   - Ukraine changed warfare doctrine
   - KTOS has more scale ($1.6B 2026 target) than ONDS ($110M)
   - ONDS is more speculative but has NDAA compliance moat

**Competitive Analysis Conclusions**:
- IREN > CIFR (execution visibility)
- COHR > LITE (valuation + 1.6T positioning)
- KTOS > ONDS (scale + proven contracts)

### January 10, 2026 - RESEARCH SESSION: Burry/Clark/Patel Roundtable

**Source**: The Substack Post (Jan 9, 2026) - roundtable with Michael Burry, Jack Clark (Anthropic), Dwarkesh Patel

**Key Insights from Burry (Bear Case)**:

1. **Infrastructure-to-application ratio is 4:1**
   - $400B in chips vs <$100B in AI application revenue
   - Spending disconnected from returns

2. **"Escalator Problem"**
   - AI won't create durable competitive advantage for most companies
   - If you implement AI, so will your competitors
   - Neither benefits—both just spent money

3. **Hardware Obsolescence**
   - Chips cycle every year
   - Data centers may become stranded assets
   - Private credit has dangerous duration mismatch

4. **"Mid-cycle" Timing**
   - Past the point where stocks reward further buildout
   - Capital expenditure continues but returns compress

5. **NVIDIA Not Durable**
   - SLMs and ASICs are the future
   - "Power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort"

**Key Insights from Clark (Bull Case)**:

1. Capabilities improving rapidly - "worst it will ever be"
2. Coding tools showing massive uptake = real value
3. Self-improving AI is a wildcard

**How This Changed My Thinking**:

- **IREN/CIFR**: Contracted revenue is the moat, not AI thesis broadly. Microsoft takes the technology risk.
- **Photonics**: Actually STRENGTHENED. If industry moves to efficiency (ASICs), still need optical interconnects.
- **Position sizing**: More conservative given "mid-cycle" concern

**Decision**: Proceed with watchlist but:
- Favor contracted revenue (IREN) over speculative (CIFR)
- Emphasize photonics as efficiency play
- Keep position sizes modest (2-3% for high conviction, 1% for speculative)

### January 10, 2026 - DECISION: Establish Watchlist

**Action**: Establish formal watchlist with entry/exit criteria

**Priority Stocks** (actionable now):
| Stock | Position Size | Entry Strategy |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| IREN | 2-3% | Buy at current levels or on pullback |
| COHR | 2-3% | Buy at current levels or on pullback |
| KTOS | 2-3% | Buy at current levels |

**Watch List** (wait for better entry):
| Stock | Position Size | Entry Trigger |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| CIFR | 1-2% | Wait for AWS revenue to begin (late 2026) or 30%+ pullback |
| LITE | 1-2% | Wait for 25-30% pullback |

**Speculative** (small positions only):
| Stock | Position Size | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| POET | 0.5-1% | Lottery ticket, can go to zero |
| ONDS | 1% | High speculation on defense drone thesis |

**Core Holdings** (to research/add for stability):
- MSFT, GOOGL, QQQ, SMH (less monitoring required)

**Reasoning**:
- Balances conviction (IREN, COHR) with speculation (POET, ONDS)
- Defined exit criteria prevent emotional decisions
- Quarterly review cadence matches buy-and-hold style
